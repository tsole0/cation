# Cation

This is a personal, work-in-progress library providing core symbolic algebra capabilities for quantum computing in Rust. The project aims to deliver efficient, canonical manipulation of quantum operators—such as sums, products, and Pauli terms—through a type-safe, extensible, and idiomatic Rust API.

The primary goal is to combine the expressiveness and ease of Python-based quantum software frameworks with the performance, safety, and concurrency advantages of Rust. This foundation is intended to support higher-level quantum computing tools and algorithms.
